			<p style="display: inline;">Password Generator relies on two algorithms:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>SHA-256</li>
				<li>Hexacrypt</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>		
				SHA-256 is what's called a hashing algorithm. It takes an input of any length, and returns a string of 64 random
				hexadecimal bytes. The same input always returns the same output. However, it is almost impossible to derive the 
				input from the output. Therefore, it is considered to be a one-way function. In addition, changing one character
				in the input completely changes the whole output in SHA-256. The javascript implementation used in Password Genex
				was programmed by Chen, Yi-Cyuan. More about his code is available at
				<a href="https://github.com/emn178/js-sha256">GitHub</a>.

				Hexacrypt, the second algorithm, is an advanced version of the Nazi Enigma Machine. Designed by Bryan McClain, 
				the algorithm can be used for encrypting and decrypting messages, given that the same key is used. The algorithm
				works by doing letter subsitution, but the subsitution string is changed for every letter in the message. Therefore,
				the output message looks completely different from the input message. The benefit to Hexacrypt is that everything is
				encoded using ASCII text characters, which makes it easy to encrypt plaintext. The version used here only needs to
				encrypt the message, and doesn't use any advanced features such as adding "Garbage" or a checksum.

				Now the actual algorithm. Password Genex concatenates all the input boxes into a single string. The string is: <br/><br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; Account &gt;:&lt; Original Password &gt;:&lt; Secret Code &gt; <br/><br/>
				This string is fed into SHA-256 and hashed. The output of this hash, which is a string consisting of 0-9 and A-F, is 
				fed into Hexacrypt with "Secret Key" as the encryption key used. This implementation of Hexacrypt also takes a third
				parameter, called "filter," which removes any illegal characters when running the password through Hexacrypt (As some passwords do
				not allow certain characters). This outputs a "Good Password" consisting of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
				You now have the perfect password for securing your accounts!
